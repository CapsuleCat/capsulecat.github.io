# Welcome!

I've launched our new website and I'm very excited about it.

We'll be posting updates (aka blog posts), game info, screenshots, and more here.

If you'd like to see more about how we made the site, you can check out the
code at [Github](https://github.com/CapsuleCat/capsulecat.github.io). The site
is powered by the following tech:

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [React Intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl)

I always like to give shout-outs to the tools and programs I use that make my
projects possible.
