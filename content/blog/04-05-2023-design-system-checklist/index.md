Creating a design system is an important part of maintaining a consistent and unified user experience across a product. This Design System Checklist provides an overview of essential elements to consider when creating and maintaining a design system.

1. Establish consistent design principles and values – Establishing a set of design principles and values is a great way to start creating a design system. These design principles will inform the design decisions you make.
2. Create a style guide – A style guide should include all the elements of the design system including typography, colors, and other design elements.
3. Design user interface components – Once the style guide has been established, designers should create design components such as buttons, menus, and other UI elements that are consistent with the style guide.
4. Create a pattern library – A pattern library is a collection of UI components that can be used to create a consistent user experience across the product.
5. Maintain the design system – Once the design system is established, it is important to maintain the design system by regularly reviewing and updating components.

This Design System Checklist is based off of a modified version of one I found a while back. I can’t seem to find the original online, but when I do, I’ll definitely link it here.
